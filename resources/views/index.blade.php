										<span class="company-name">Inthost.biz web hosting service (owner)</span>
										<p>Running my own Web-Hosting service along with work as a tech-support for insa-payment terminals back in my home city S-Peterburg, Russia. 
											I've learnt basic web programming, maintanance and troubleshooting of PCs, servers and webservices, such as mail, web-server, database and so on

										<span class="company-name">724Care Inc, Cebu Philippines (IT manager, PHP Developer)</span>
										<p>In 2009 I decided to move over to the Philippines. 
											Applied as a technician to a call-center in Cebu City, after a while I was promoted to the IT manager position. 
											It was interesting job and I've gained much of my knowledge from the company founders  
											whose were skilled and experienced IT experts with strong IT-ingeneering background. 
											In a few years I became Asterisk (SIP server) expert, database maintainer (MySQL), Network engeneer. 
											In 2012 the company had high demand for a PHP developer. So as a part-timer I started to work as PHP coder,
											developing our own dialer (based on GNUDialer), which we sucessfully used for outbound calls. 
											The core of the dialer was written in C++, which I had to modify in order to work with the new agent's interface, 
											which I made in Vanilla PHP and jQuery.
											Another my project was <a href="https://github.com/vldmitrofanov/yp-downloader" target=_blank>PHP YellowPages parser</a> 
											(Vanilla PHP and Wordpress plugin). As an outbound callcenter we always were in needs of fresh leads. So my parser has come handy. 
											It could parse and download a few hundred thousands leads a day. Also a back-end, where operator can filter leads by zip-codes, cities or states, 
											remove duplicates, create order to download selected areas/businesses.
											All downloading was going through a proxies whose were downloaded and tested automatically. 
											Thousands lines of PHP code and Bash scripting I wrote made me think about turning into a web developer eventually.
